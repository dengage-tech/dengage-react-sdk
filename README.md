# react-native-dengage

**dEngage Customer Driven Marketing Platform (CDMP)** serves as a customer data platform (CDP) with built-in omnichannel marketing features. It replaces your marketing automation and cross-channel campaign management.
The platform positions itself between our clientâ€™s data sources and its customers. It is also capable of exporting anonymous data to 3rd party networks such as **Oracle Bluekai, Criteo, Facebook Custom Audiences** and **Google Customer** Match to support retargeting and remarketing efforts of our clients.
