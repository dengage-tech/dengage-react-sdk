# react-native-dengage

dEngage Customer Driven Marketing Platform (CDMP) serves as a customer data platform (CDP) with built-in omnichannel marketing features. It replaces your marketing automation and cross-channel campaign management.
The platform positions itself between our clientâ€™s data sources and its customers. It is also capable of exporting anonymous data to 3rd party networks such as Oracle Bluekai, Criteo, Facebook Custom Audiences and Google Customer Match to support retargeting and remarketing efforts of our clients.
